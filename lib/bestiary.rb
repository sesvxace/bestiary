# Bestiary v1.2 by Enelvon
# =============================================================================
# 
# Summary
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   This script is intended to provide an extremely customizable bestiary for
# use in a variety of situations. Every aspect of the layout can be altered by
# the developer, including the number of pages and types of information
# displayed. Future updates are likely to contain new fields and bugfixes
# rather than large overhauls of the system, unless the general public finds
# the customization to be unreasonably difficult (something that I find
# unlikely, as none of my non-scripter beta testers had difficulty with it). I
# included almost all of the major features that I could think of in this first
# release, so I would appreciate it if users would suggest ideas for
# improvements and new features!
# 
# Compatibility Information
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# **Required Scripts:**
#   SES Core v2.2 or higher and SES Window Book v3.0 or higher.
# 
# **Known Incompatibilities:**
#   None, and as this is a new class (and thus contains no direct redefinitions
# of the base scripts), it should never have any. It does contain a few new
# methods for existing classes, but nothing that is likely to cause problems.
# It does have a few aliases, but none that should cause any problems - or so I
# think, though I could be absolutely wrong.
# 
# Usage
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   This script has a large number of configuration options, all of which are
# detailed in the `SES::Bestiary` module. They will not be described in this
# section, as I despise redundancy. What this section *will* cover is the
# series of note tags that this script adds to Enemies. It will also discuss
# the series of script calls that can be used to add data to the bestiary (only
# relevant if you set things to require discovery in the configuration). I will
# begin by explaining the two ways to open the bestiary, though.
# 
# ### Opening the Bestiary:
#   There are two ways to open the bestiary: the first allows you to open it to
# a specific page and allow the user to scroll through it from there, while the
# second allows you to open a list of enemies and allow the user to select
# enemies from there.
# 
# #### Option One: Opening the Bestiary as a Book
#   This can be accomplished with a simple `show_book` call:
# 
#     show_book(Bestiary.new(ID, Turnable))
# 
#   Simply replace `ID` with the ID of the enemy whose page you would like to
# begin on. `Turnable` should be `true` or `false`, depending on whether or not
# you would like the pages to be turnable.
# 
# #### Option Two: Opening the Bestiary as a Scene
#   This is accomplished in the same way that you would access any other scene:
# 
#     SceneManager.call(Scene_Bestiary)
# 
# ### Enemy Note Tags:
#
# This script now has a Demiurge plugin! You can find the link to it in the
# thread, or in the GitHub archive. I highly recommend using that instead of
# manually configuring Note tags.
# 
# `<Bestiary X Offset: !X!>`
# 
#   Place this in a Notes box to alter the draw X of the enemy's image in the
# bestiary.
# 
# **Replacements:**
# 
# `!X!` with the number of pixels by which to move the enemy's image. Positive
# values will move it towards the right while negative values will move it
# towards the left.
# 
# `<Bestiary Y Offset: !Y!>`
# 
#   Place this in a Notes box to alter the draw Y of the enemy's image in the
# bestiary.
# 
# **Replacements:**
# 
# `!Y!` with the number of pixels by which to move the enemy's image. Positive
# values will move it towards the bottom while negative values will move it
# towards the top.
# 
# `<Bestiary Hide !Type!>`
# 
# Place this in a Notes box to prevent part of an enemy's data from being
# displayed. This is useful for bosses.
# 
# **Replacements:**
# 
# `!Type!` with the type of data you would like to hide. This can be Skills,
# Elements, States, or Enemy. The first three hide their respective areas, while
# the last prevents the enemy from appearing in the bestiary at all and serves
# as an alternative to the HiddenEnemies array.
# 
# `<Bestiary Hide Skill: !ID!>`
# 
# Place this in a Notes box to prevent a given skill from appearing in the list
# of an enemy's skills.
# 
# **Replacements:**
# 
# `!ID!` with the ID of the skill you would like to hide. This tag can hold
# more than one ID, formatted like this: `<Bestiary Hide Skill: 1, 2>`
# 
# It can contain an unlimited number of IDs - just don't press Enter until
# you've closed the tag. The automatic wrapping in the Notes box doesn't
# actually introduce a new line.
# 
# `<Bestiary Parameter !Name!: !Value!>`
# 
#   Place this in a Notes box to change the value of a given method or variable
# for the purposes of display in the bestiary (and only the purposes of display
# in the bestiary - this affects nothing else). This can also be used to create
# 'fake' variables that are only used in custom bestiary fields - they can be
# accessed via the name you give them within bestiary configuration.
# 
# **Replacements:**
# 
# `!Name!` with the name of the variable or method whose content you are
# altering or creating.
# 
# `!Value!` with the value it should hold. This can be anything, as it will be
# treated as a String (display only and all that).
# 
# `<Bestiary Hide All (Stats|Parameters|Params)>`
# 
#   Place this in a Notes box to have all of an enemy's basic stats (HP, MP,
# ATK, and so on) drawn as ???. A convenience method for bosses and other
# special enemies.
# 
# **Replacements:**
# 
# None - just choose one of the three names in the parentheses of the tag. Only
# use one - multiple possibilities are included due to variance in the
# preferences of developers.
# 
# ```
# <Bestiary Description>
#   ...TEXT...
#   ...TEXT...
# </Bestiary Description>
# ```
# 
#   Place this in a Notes box to determine what will be drawn for an enemy's
# description. Everything between the opening and closing tags will be
# considered part of the description. Text will be automatically wrapped to
# fit, and any line breaks manually inserted with Enter will drop to a new line
# regardless of position when the description is drawn.
# 
# **Replacements:**
# 
# None - just make sure to include a description. If this tag is absent from an
# enemy, an empty description will be drawn.
# 
# Script Calls
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   These can be used in events or within your own scripts, as they are all
# calls to `$game_party`.
# 
#     $game_party.reveal_bestiary_enemy(ID)
# 
#   Replace `ID` with the ID of the enemy that you would like to reveal. This
# call causes **all** of the enemy's data to be marked as known.
# 
#     $game_party.add_bestiary_enemy(ID, Defeated)
# 
#   Replace `ID` with the ID of the enemy that you would like to add and
# `Defeated` with either `true` (the counter for the number of defeated enemies
# should be incremented) or `false` (it should not). This will only make the
# page visible -- it will not mark any individual pieces of data as known.
# 
#     $game_party.add_bestiary_data(ID, Type, Data)
# 
#   This is the most complicated of the calls. Replace `ID` with the ID of the
# enemy whose data you are updating. `Type` should be `:dro` for Drops, `:ele`
# for Elements, `:sta` for States, or `:ski` for Skills. Data varies depending
# on the Type. For `:ele`, `:sta`, and `:ski`, it should be the ID of an
# Element, State, or Skill. For `:dro`, it should be a string in the format
# `"Kind-ID"`. Kind should be 1 (for Items), 2 (for Weapons), or 3 (for
# Armors). ID is the Database ID of the item in question.

    # single line of space may be taken up, such as for the display of elemental
